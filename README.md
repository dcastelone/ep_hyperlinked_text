## What is this?
This is a simple plugin that adds embedded text hyperlinks. It is based on the https://github.com/ether/ep_font_color plugin (for fundamentals of hooks and HTML export). The plugin is experimental, please use at your own risk.

This differs from some of the older hyperlink plugins potentially but, at least with etherpad 2.2.7, doesn't have the CSS styling bleed issue of other versions, adds the hyperlink title attribute, and on click action opens the link tab rather than prompting to edit.
